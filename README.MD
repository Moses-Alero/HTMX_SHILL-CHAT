# HTMX SHILL CHAT 

Simple chat app built with  HTMX, Decided to give it a shot along with python since I havent used it in a while
Might explore More complex implementations later but for now I am pretty comfortable with this.

If you want to try it out well go ahead and give it a shot
Just install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt`,
     `pip install`
     run the app: `uvicorn main:app --reload``
I will be back to this project later but for now I have satisfied my curiosity
